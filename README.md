## Description
This repository contains an academic assignment focusing on the fundamental concepts of basic statistics. Developed as part of an Excelr training program, this project demonstrates the application of key statistical measures and data analysis techniques using Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The goal is to perform an initial exploratory analysis on a given dataset, making it an excellent resource for anyone looking to understand core statistical principles applied in a practical context.

## Key Features
*   **Foundational Statistical Analysis:** Computation and interpretation of basic statistical measures like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
*   **Data Loading & Manipulation:** Efficient handling and preliminary cleaning of tabular data, specifically a sales dataset, using Python libraries.
*   **Interactive Learning Environment:** Utilizes Jupyter Notebook for a step-by-step, executable, and well-documented analysis workflow.
*   **Practical Data Application:** Applies statistical concepts to a real-world `sales_data_with_discounts.csv` dataset, demonstrating insights derivation.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Supported by a `.docx` document potentially outlining theoretical concepts or assignment guidelines.

## Technologies Used
*   **Python 3.x:** The core programming language.
*   **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive computing, analysis, and documentation.
*   **Pandas:** Essential library for data manipulation and analysis, especially for handling CSV files.
*   **NumPy:** Fundamental package for numerical computing in Python.

## Installation & Usage

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Basic-stats-1-Assignment-No-1Excelr.git
    cd Basic-stats-1-Assignment-No-1Excelr
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy jupyter
    ```

4.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

5.  **Open and run the notebook:**
    In the Jupyter interface, navigate to `Basic_stats_1.ipynb` and open it. You can run all cells by selecting `Cell > Run All` from the menu. Explore the code and markdown cells to understand the statistical analysis performed.
